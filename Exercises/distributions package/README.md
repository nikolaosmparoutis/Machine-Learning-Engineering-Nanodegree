In this exercise, you'll extend the distributions package with a new class called Binomial. 

When you're ready to test out your code, you'll want to pip install your distributions package and then run the unit tests.
type `pip install .` Then run the unit tests by typing `python -m unittest test`. 

Note that if you change the code in the distributions folder after pip installing the package, Python will not know about the changes. 
You'll need to run `pip install --upgrade .` when you make changes to the package files.

See the metadata of the package after the installation typing: 
`python -m pip show distributions`
